A website that displays a map of summoner's rift. The user clicks two points on the map and inputs a movement speed value. The website outputs the time it would take to travel from point A to point B using this MS value.

1. Implement A*
	- Given a graph and two points, find the optimal path from point A to point B
	- Will not use my own version of the algorithim for my final version (probably), but would like to learn how the algorithim works
2. Create a program that displays a map and allows the user to click on two points and outputs the optimal path
	- How do I want to incorporate movement speed/time into this step?
	- Maybe just assume MS is 1. 
3. Recreate summoner's rift as a graph
	- Using position data from Riot API 
4. Combine 3 and 4 to create the app.
5. Use this as the backend for a website
