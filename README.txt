Goals of this project
1. Implement the A* algorithim on a 2D vector
2. Use a mapping library to display a map (graph) on the user's screen
    - User inputs two points with clicks on a map
    - Algorithim (A*) finds and displays the shortest path between these points, factoring in obstacles
3. Recreate the League of Legends Summoner's Rift map
    - Use this map as the basis for the program
4. Port this application onto a webapp / website
    - Django
